Formalizing the Holographic Mapping: From Weil Anomalies to Tensor Network Isometry Loss

To move beyond the heuristic of scalar edge weights, we formalize the mapping of Weil anomalies using the operator-algebraic structure of p-adic Holographic Quantum Error Correcting Codes (HQECCs), synthesizing the frameworks of Gubser et al. (p-adic AdS/CFT) and Pastawski et al. (HaPPY codes).

1. The Unperturbed Bulk Geometry (Exact Isometry)
   In p-adic AdS/CFT, the bulk geometry is a Bruhat-Tits tree $T_p$ where every vertex has a coordination number of $p+1$. We construct a HaPPY-like Tree Tensor Network (TTN) by placing a tensor $T_0$ at each vertex.
   Orienting the tree from the bulk center toward the p-adic boundary $\mathbb{Q}_p$, each vertex acts as a map from 1 logical incoming bulk leg to $p$ physical outgoing legs: $T_0: V \to V^{\otimes p}$.
   For $T_0$ to generate a valid holographic QECC, it must be an exact isometry:
   $T_0^\dagger T_0 = I_V$
   This represents a pristine bulk spacetime where quantum information is perfectly protected against boundary erasures.

2. Coupling the Weil Anomaly
   In standard AdS/CFT, boundary data strictly dictates bulk dynamics (e.g., the boundary scaling dimension $\Delta$ fixes the bulk mass $m^2$). Here, we treat the local prime contribution $W_p(f)$ from Weil's explicit formula as a physical deformation parameter.
   Let $W_p^{(0)}$ be the ideal contribution of prime $p$ when the Riemann Hypothesis holds exactly. We define a dimensionless Weil anomaly:
   $$ \delta_p = \frac{W_p^{(0)} - W_p(f)}{W_p^{(0)}} $$

If RH holds, the functional balances completely, and $\delta_p = 0$. A shifted zero reduces the local prime contribution, yielding $\delta_p > 0$.

3. Deforming the Tensor Network
   A non-zero anomaly $\delta_p$ corresponds to the insertion of a local, non-unitary attenuation channel at the bulk vertex. We define the Weil-deformed tensor $T(W_p)$ as:
   $T(W_p) = e^{-\alpha  \delta_p  K_p}  T_0$
   Here, $\alpha > 0$ is a coupling constant, and $K_p$ is a positive-definite operator corresponding to the local vertex Hamiltonian. To conceptually bridge this to the Bost-Connes system—where the Hamiltonian spectrum is generated by the logarithms of primes—we can associate $K_p \propto (\log p) I_V$.

4. The Breakdown of Quantum Error Correction
   We can now evaluate the isometry condition of the deformed bulk tensor:
   $$ T(W_p)^\dagger T(W_p) = T_0^\dagger e^{-2\alpha \delta_p K_p} T_0 < I_V $$

Regime 1 (RH holds): $W_p(f) = W_p^{(0)} \implies \delta_p = 0$. The exponential resolves to the identity, yielding $T^\dagger T = I_V$. The Bruhat-Tits tree remains a perfect HQECC.

Regime 2 (RH breaks): $\delta_p > 0$. Because $K_p$ is positive-definite, the eigenvalues of the exponential operator are strictly less than $1$. Therefore:
$T(W_p)^\dagger T(W_p) < I_V$

Conclusion
In the rigorous language of Quantum Information Theory, the map from the bulk to the boundary is no longer an exact isometric embedding, but a completely positive trace-decreasing map (a lossy quantum channel).
By mapping the analytic number theory directly to the operator algebra of the tensor network, a zero shifting off the critical line translates directly into a non-unitary deformation in the Bruhat-Tits bulk. This explicitly violates the exact quantum error correction conditions, introducing a finite infidelity and destroying the perfect holographic properties of the spacetime.
