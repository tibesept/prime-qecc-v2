# Prime Number QECC

This is a numerical toy model in Python that attempts to build a
computational bridge between three otherwise unconnected mathematical
frameworks:

- **Weil's explicit formula** (analytic number theory): a distribution
  that relates the prime numbers and the non-trivial zeros of the
  Riemann zeta function. Weil positivity of this distribution is
  known to be equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis.

- **Bost-Connes system** (noncommutative geometry): a quantum
  statistical mechanical system whose Hamiltonian is built from
  logarithms of primes, whose partition function is exactly the
  Riemann zeta function, and which undergoes a phase transition
  precisely at the pole β = 1.

- **p-adic AdS/CFT** (Gubser et al., arXiv:1605.01078): a holographic
  model in which the bulk of spacetime is replaced by a Bruhat-Tits
  tree - a discrete fractal graph generated by a prime number p.

## Hypothesis

Holographic spacetime in standard AdS/CFT is known to function as a
quantum error-correcting code (Almheiri, Dong, Harlow, arXiv:1411.7041).
If we build holographic spacetime out of prime-number fractals (p-adic
AdS/CFT), does the thermodynamic stability of a prime-based system
(Bost-Connes) correspond to the error-correcting stability of that
spacetime?

Concretely: when a Riemann zero is perturbed off the critical line,
the Weil functional W(f) loses positivity. This project numerically
tracks whether that loss of positivity propagates as a breakdown of
unitarity in the edge weights of a Bruhat-Tits tree — a proxy for a
p-adic holographic tensor network.

This is not a proof of anything. It is an attempt to see if the
analogy holds up computationally before asking whether it can be
made rigorous.

## 📖 Theoretical Framework

While the Python code in this repository models the anomaly heuristically using scalar graph weights, the actual physical mapping requires formal operator-algebraic structures.

To see the rigorous mathematical formulation of how a Weil anomaly ($\delta_p$) geometrically translates into a non-unitary deformation operator ($e^{-\alpha \delta_p K_p}$) and destroys the exact isometry of a p-adic Holographic Quantum Error Correcting Code, please read the formal theoretical breakdown:
